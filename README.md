## Install

1. Clone down the api server `git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fitlit-api`
   1. This API holds the data our project will fetch in order to populate the browser with info
2. CD into your local clone `cd fitlit-api`
3. Install project dependencies `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Clone down this repository `git clone https://github.com/tylrs/fitlit-optionA`
6. CD into your local clone `cd fitlit-optionA`
7. Install project dependencies `npm install`
8. Run `npm start` and open `localhost:8080` in your preferred browser

## Goals
* Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone elseâ€™s codebase
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
